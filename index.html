          JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the
          year 1995, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple
          programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging
          programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular
          programs.
          <br>
          Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language
          and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
          possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers
          to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all
          platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte
          code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is
          similar to c/c++.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language
          created in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a
          team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java
          language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public
          implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on
          popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur
          Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival
          of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for
          different types of platforms.
          <br>
          In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the
          ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew
          from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java
          implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary
          software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling
          of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise
          System.
          <br>
          On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual
          machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished
          the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under
          open-source distribution terms.
          <br>
          The principles for creating java were
          simple, robust, secured, high performance, portable, multi-threaded,
          interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by James
          Gosling, who is known as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used
          in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Java programming language is named JAVA. Why?</h2>
        <p>
          After the name OAK, the team decided to give a new name to it and the
          suggested words were Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc.
          These all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they all wanted
          the name to reflect the essence of technology. In accordance with
          James Gosling, Java the among the top names along with Silk, and since
          java was a unique name so most of them preferred it.
          <br>
          Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first
          coffee(named java coffee) was produced. And this name was chosen by
          James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is 
          just a name, not an acronym.
        </p>
        <h2>Java Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these
          common terms of Java.
          <br>
          1. Java Virtual Machine(JVM): This is generally
          referred to as JVM. There are three execution phases of a program.
          They are written, compile and run the program.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.</li>
            <li>The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary
                Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes
                the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.</li>
            <li>In the Running phase of a program, JVM
                executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute
          the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different 
          JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the
          same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a
          platform-independent language.
          <br>
          2. Bytecode in the Development process:
          As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code
          into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class
          file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap
          can be used.
          <br>
          3. Java Development Kit(JDK): While we were using the
          term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name
          suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes
          everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java
          debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need
          to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the
          java program.
          <br>
          4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE): JDK includes JRE. JRE
          installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however,
          we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports,
          and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.
          <br>
          5. Garbage Collector: In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. To
          delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage
          Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not
          referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling
          memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their
          code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long
          time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being
          referenced.
          <br>
          6. ClassPath: The classpath is the file path where the
          java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By
          default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external
          libraries they should be added to the classpath.
        </p>
        <h2>Primary/Main Features of Java</h2>
        <p>
          1. Platform Independent: Compiler converts source code to
          bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the
          compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux,
          macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run
          it on Linux and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM,
          but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution
          of bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.
          <br>
          2. Object-Oriented Programming Language: Organizing the program in the
          terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented
          programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.
          <br>
          The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        3. Simple: Java is one of the
          simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers,
          operator overloading, multiple inheritances, Explicit memory
          allocation.
          <br>
          4. Robust: Java language is robust which means reliable.
          It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into
          checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is
          able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by
          another programming language. The main features of java that make it
          robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory
          allocation.
          <br>
          5. Secure: In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot
          access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception
          if we try to do so. That’s why several security flaws like stack
          corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java.
          <br>
          6. Distributed: We can create distributed applications using the java
          programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java
          Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The java
          programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that are
          connected to each other through an internet connection.
          <br>
          7. Multithreading: Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature
          that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for
          maximum utilization of CPU.
          <br>
          8. Portable: As we know, java code written
          on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent
          feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be
          taken to any platform for execution makes java portable.
          <br>
          9. High Performance: Java architecture is defined in such a way that it
          reduces overhead during the runtime and at some time java uses Just In
          Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand basics
          where it only compiles those methods that are called making
          applications to execute faster.
          <br>
          10. Dynamic flexibility: Java being
          completely object-oriented gives us the flexibility to add classes,
          new methods to existing classes and even create new classes through
          sub-classes. Java even supports functions written in other languages
          such as C, C++ which are referred to as native methods.
          <br>
          11. Sandbox Execution: Java programs run in a separate space that allows user
          to execute their applications without affecting the underlying system
          with help of a bytecode verifier. Bytecode verifier also provides
          additional security as its role is to check the code for any violation
          of access.
          <br>
          12. Write Once Run Anywhere: As discussed above java
          application generates a ‘.class’ file which corresponds to our
          applications(program) but contains code in binary format. It provides
          ease t architecture-neutral ease as bytecode is not dependent on any
          machine architecture. It is the primary reason java is used in the
          enterprising IT industry globally worldwide.
          <br>
          13. Power of compilation and interpretation: Most languages are designed 
          with purpose either they are compiled language or they are interpreted language. 
          But java integrates arising enormous power as Java compiler compiles the source
          code to bytecode and JVM executes this bytecode to machine
          OS-dependent executable code.
        </p>

        <header>Versions</header>
        <p>
            The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous 
            additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the 
            evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP),
            which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and 
            changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language 
            Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. In September 2017,
            Mark Reinhold, chief Architect of the Java Platform, proposed to change the release 
            train to "one feature release every six months" rather than the then-current two-year 
            schedule. This proposal took effect for all following versions, and is still the 
            current release schedule.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            In addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class 
            Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over 
            three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and Java2D, have been 
            introduced, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated.
            Some programs allow conversion of Java programs from one version of the Java platform
            to an older one (for example Java 5.0 backported to 1.4).
        </p>
        <p>    
            Regarding Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap, version 18 is that latest versions, and 
            versions 17, 11 and 8 are the currently supported long-term support (LTS) versions, 
            where Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support. Java 8 LTS last free 
            software public update for commercial use was released by Oracle in January 2019, 
            while Oracle continues to release no-cost public Java 8 updates for development and 
            personal use indefinitely. Java 7 is no longer publicly supported. For Java 11, 
            long-term support will not be provided by Oracle for the public; instead, the broader 
            OpenJDK community, as Eclipse Adoptium or others, is expected to perform the work.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Java 18 General Availability began on March 22, 2022, and for Java 17, the latest (3rd) 
            LTS on September 14, 2021. Java 19 is in development with early-access builds already 
            available.

        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
            Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program 
            execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity 
            of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data.
            <br>
            A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a 
            program.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.</li>
            <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on 
                the variable effects that memory location.</li>
            <li>In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to declare variables?</h2>
        <p>
            We can declare variables in java as pictorially depicted below as a visual aid.
        </p>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/958/0*cWwqpL95fpqGFvPD.jpeg" alt="Declaring variables in Java" class="img-main-section">
        <p>
            From the image, it can be easily perceived that while declaring a variable, we need to 
            take care of two things that are:
            <br>
            1. Datatype: Type of data that can be stored in this variable.
            <br> 
            2. Dataname: Name was given to the variable.
            <br>
            In this way, a name can only be given to a memory location. It can be assigned values in two ways:
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Variable Initialization</li>
            <li>Assigning value by taking input</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to initialize variables?</h2>
        <p>
            It can be perceived with the help of 3 components that are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>datatype: Type of data that can be stored in this variable.</li>
            <li>variable_name: Name given to the variable.</li>
            <li>value: It is the initial value stored in the variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/580/0*nWdH1qYbt6OrRLCR.png" alt="Initialize variables" class="img-main-section">
        <h2>Types of Variables in Java</h2>
        <p>
        Now let us discuss different types of variables which are listed as follows: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Local Variables</li>
            <li>Instance Variables</li>
            <li>Static Variables</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/core/images/types-of-variables1.png" alt="Types of variables" class="img-main-section">
        <p>
          Let us discuss the traits of every variable been up here in detail.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Local Variables</h2>
        <p>
          A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These variables are created when the block is entered, or the function is called and
             destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.</li>
          <li>The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is 
            declared. i.e., we can access these variables only within that block.</li>
          <li>Initialization of the local variable is mandatory before using it in the defined scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
        import java.io.*;<br><br>
        class GFG {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args){<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int var = 10; // Declared a Local Variable<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// This variable is local to this main method only<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Local Variable: " + var);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        }<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        Output<br>
        Local Variable: 10
      </p>
      <h2>2. Instance Variables</h2>
      <p>
        Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method,
         constructor, or block.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the 
          class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.</li>
        <li>Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify
          any access specifier, then the default access specifier will be used.</li>
        <li>Initialization of Instance Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0</li>
        <li>Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.</li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        /*package whatever //do not write package name here */<br><br>
        import java.io.*;<br><br>
        class GFG {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public String geek; // Declared Instance Variable<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public GFG() { // Default Constructor<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.geek = "Shubham Jain"; // initializing Instance Variable<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        //Main Method<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args){<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Object Creation<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GFG name = new GFG();<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Displaying O/P<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Geek name is: " + name.geek);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        Output<br>
        Geek name is: Shubham Jain
      </p>
      <h2>3. Static Variables</h2>
      <p>
        Static variables are also known as Class variables.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>These variables are declared similarly as instance variables. The difference 
          is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class 
          outside any method constructor or block.</li>
        <li>Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per 
          class irrespective of how many objects we create.</li>
        <li>Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed 
          automatically when execution ends.</li>
        <li>Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0</li>
        <li>If we access the static variable like the Instance variable (through an object),
           the compiler will show the warning message, which won’t halt the program. The 
           compiler will replace the object name with the class name automatically.</li>
        <li>If we access the static variable without the class name, the compiler will 
          automatically append the class name.</li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        /*package whatever //do not write package name here */<br><br>
        import java.io.*;<br><br>
        class GFG {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static String geek = "Shubham Jain";//Declared static variable<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main (String[] args) {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//geek variable can be accessed withod object creation<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//Displaying O/P<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//GFG.geek --> using the static variable<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Geek Name is : "+GFG.geek);<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        }<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        Output<br>
        Geek Name is : Shubham Jain
      </p>
      <h2>Differences between the Instance variables and the Static variables</h2>
      <p>
        Now let us discuss the differences between the Instance variables and the Static variables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each object will have its copy of the instance variable, whereas We can only 
          have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects 
          we create.</li>
        <li>Changes made in an instance variable using one object will not be reflected 
          in other objects as each object has its own copy of the instance variable. In 
          the case of static, changes will be reflected in other objects as static variables
           are common to all objects of a class.</li>
        <li>We can access instance variables through object references, and Static Variables 
          can be accessed directly using the class name.</li>
      </ul>

        <header>Conditionals and loops</header>
        <h2>Java Conditions and if Statements</h2>
        <p>
          Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Less than: a < b</li>
          <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
          <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
          <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
          <li>Equal to a == b</li>
          <li>Not Equal to: a != b</li>    
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.<br>
          Java has the following conditional statements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
          <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
          <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
          <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The if Statement</h2>
        <p>Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.</p>
        <code>
          if (condition) {<br>
          &nbsp;// block of code to be executed if the condition is true<br>
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.<br>
          In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition
          is true, print some text:
        </p>
        <code>
          if (20 > 18) {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("20 is greater than 18");<br>
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          We can also test variables:
        </p>
        <code>
          int x = 20;<br>
          int y = 18;<br>
          if (x > y) {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("x is greater than y");<br>
          }
        </code>
        <h2>The else Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
        </p>
        <code>
          if (condition) {<br>
          &nbsp;// block of code to be executed if the condition is true<br>
          } else {<br>
          &nbsp;// block of code to be executed if the condition is false
          }
        </code>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <code>
          int time = 20;<br>
          if (time < 18) {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("Good day.");<br>
          } else {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("Good evening.");<br>
          }<br>
          // Outputs "Good evening."
        </code>
        <h2>The else if Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
        </p>
        <code>
          if (condition1) {<br>
          &nbsp;// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true<br>
          } else if (condition2) {<br>
          &nbsp;// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true<br>
          } else {<br>
          &nbsp;// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false<br>
          }
        </code>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <code>
          int time = 22;<br>
          if (time < 10) {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("Good morning.");<br>
          } else if (time < 20) {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("Good day.");<br>
          } else {<br>
          &nbsp;System.out.println("Good evening.");<br>
          }<br>
          // Outputs "Good evening."
        </code>
        <h2>Loops in Java</h2>
        <p>
          Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of
          a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. 
          Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar 
          basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be 
            executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be 
            thought of as a repeating if statement. 
            <code>
              while (boolean condition){<br>
              &nbsp;loop statements...<br>
              }
            </code>
            <h2>Flowchart:</h2>
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Loop1.png" alt="while loop" class="img-loops">
            <ul>
              <li>While loop starts with the checking of condition. If it evaluated to true, then 
                the loop body statements are executed otherwise first statement following the 
                loop is executed. For this reason it is also called Entry control loop.</li>
              <li>Once the condition is evaluated to true, the statements in the loop body are
                 executed. Normally the statements contain an update value for the variable being 
                 processed for the next iteration.</li>
              <li>When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates which marks the end of its 
                life cycle.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>for loop: for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a 
            while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement 
            in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
            <code>
              for (initialization condition; testing condition; increment/decrement){<br>
              &nbsp;statement(s)<br>
              }
            </code>
            <h2>Flowchart:</h2>
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/loop2.png" alt="for loop" class="img-loops">
            <ul>
              <li>Initialization condition: Here, we initialize the variable in use. It marks
                 the start of a for loop. An already declared variable can be used or a variable
                  can be declared, local to loop only.</li>
              <li>Testing Condition: It is used for testing the exit condition for a loop. It 
                must return a boolean value. It is also an Entry Control Loop as the condition 
                is checked prior to the execution of the loop statements.</li>
              <li>Statement execution: Once the condition is evaluated to true, the statements 
                in the loop body are executed.</li>
              <li>Increment/ Decrement: It is used for updating the variable for next iteration.</li>
              <li>Loop termination:When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates marking
                 the end of its life cycle.</li>     
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>do while: do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks 
            for condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop. 
            <code>
              do{<br>
              &nbsp;statements...<br>
              }<br>
              while (condition);
            </code>
            <h2>Flowchart:</h2>
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/loop3.png" alt="do while loop" class="img-loops">
            <ul>
              <li>do while loop starts with the execution of the statement(s). There is no 
                checking of any condition for the first time.</li>
              <li>After the execution of the statements, and update of the variable value, 
                the condition is checked for true or false value. If it is evaluated to true, 
                next iteration of loop starts.</li>
              <li>When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates which marks the end of
                 its life cycle.</li>
              <li>It is important to note that the do-while loop will execute its statements 
                atleast once before any condition is checked, and therefore is an example of 
                exit control loop.</li>

        <header>Object oriented programming</header>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use
           objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities 
           like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind 
           together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code 
           can access this data except that function. 
           <br>
           Let us discuss prerequisites by polishing concepts of method declaration and message passing. 
           Starting off with the method declaration, it consists of six components: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access Modifier: Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed 
            in your application. In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers: 
            <ul><li>public: Accessible in all classes in your application.</li>
            <li>protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es) 
              (including subclasses declared outside the package).</li>
            <li>private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.</li>
            <li>default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within the same class 
              and package within which its class is defined.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The return type: The data type of the value returned by the method or void if it does not 
            return a value.</li>
          <li>Method Name: The rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention 
            is a little different.</li>
          <li>Parameter list: Comma-separated list of the input parameters that are defined, preceded 
            by their data type, within the enclosed parentheses. If there are no parameters, you must 
            use empty parentheses ().</li>
          <li>Exception list: The exceptions you expect the method to throw. You can specify these exception(s).</li>
          <li>Method body: It is the block of code, enclosed between braces, that you need to execute to 
            perform your intended operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Message Passing: Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to 
          each other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore 
          will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message 
          passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function and the information 
          to be sent.
          <br>
          Now that we have covered the basic prerequisites, we will move on to the 4 pillars of OOPs which 
          are as follows. But, let us start by learning about the different characteristics of an Object-Oriented 
          Programming Language.
          <br>
          OOPs concepts are as follows:
        </p> 
        <ol>
          <li>Class</li>
          <li>Object</li>
          <li>Method and method passing</li>
          <li>Pillars of OOPs

              <li>Encapsulation</li>
              <li>Inheritance</li>
              <li>Polymorphism
                <ul>
                  <li>Compile-time polymorphism</li>
                  <li>Runtime polymorphism</li>

        <p>
          A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
          It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of 
          one type. In general, class declarations can include these components in order:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Modifiers: A class can be public or have default access (Refer this for details).</li>
          <li>Class name: The class name should begin with the initial letter capitalized by convention.</li>
          <li>Superclass (if any): The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded 
            by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.</li>
          <li>Interfaces (if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, 
            if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.</li>
          <li>Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Object is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming that represents the real life entities. 
          A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. 
          An object consists of:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of 
            an object.</li>
          <li>Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an 
            object to other objects.</li>
          <li>Identity: It is a unique name given to an object that enables it to interact with other objects.</li>
          <li>Method: A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the 
            result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods 
            allow us to reuse the code without retyping it, which is why they are considered time savers. In 
            Java, every method must be part of some class, which is different from languages like C, C++ and 
            Python. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let us now discuss the 4 pillars of OOPs:</p>
        <h2>Pillar 1: Abstraction</h2>
        <p>
          Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the 
          user. The trivial or non-essential units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car 
          rather than its individual components.<br>
          Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics 
          of an object, ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviors of an object 
          differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the 
          object.<br>
          Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the 
          accelerators will increase the car speed or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know 
          how on pressing the accelerator, the speed is actually increasing. He does not know about the inner 
          mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerators, brakes etc. in the car. This is what 
          abstraction is.<br>
          In Java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction 
          using interfaces.

        <h2>Pillar 2: Encapsulation</h2>
        <p>
          It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technically, in encapsulation, the variables or the data in a class is hidden from any other 
            class and can be accessed only through any member function of the class in which they are 
            declared.</li>
          <li>In encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, which is similar to what 
            data-hiding does. So, the terms “encapsulation” and “data-hiding” are used interchangeably.</li>
          <li>Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and writing 
            public methods in the class to set and get the values of the variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pillar 3: Inheritance </h2>
        <p>
          Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in 
          Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.<br>
          Let us discuss some frequently used important terminologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Superclass: The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass (also known as base 
            or parent class).</li>
          <li>Subclass: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass (also known as derived 
            or extended or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the 
            superclass fields and methods.</li>
          <li>Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a 
            new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive 
            our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the 
            existing class.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pillar 4: Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>
          It refers to the ability of object-oriented programming languages to differentiate between entities 
          with the same name efficiently. This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration 
          of these entities.
